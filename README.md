# CRUDOps: Simple Video Management API 🎥

Welcome to CRUDOps, a simple yet powerful video management API built with Node.js and Fastify 🚀. This API allows you to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on videos stored in local memory using a Map for quick and efficient access. Whether you're developing a new project or learning the ins and outs of API development, CRUDOps offers a straightforward way to manage video data 📹.

## Features 🌟

- **Create Videos:** Add new videos with titles, descriptions, and durations 🆕.
- **Read Videos:** Fetch a list of all videos stored in the database 📖.
- **Update Videos:** Modify the details of existing videos using their unique IDs 🔧.
- **Delete Videos:** Remove videos from the database using their unique IDs 🗑️.

## Getting Started 🚀

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If you need to install Node.js, visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) for download and installation instructions.

### Installation 📦

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.

### Running the Server 🏃‍♂️

To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `localhost:3333`. You are now ready to perform CRUD operations on videos 🎬.

## Usage 💡

Here are examples of how you can use CRUDOps to manage videos. Use an API client like Postman or send HTTP requests directly to interact with the API.

### Create a Video 📝

To add a new video, send a `POST` request to `/videos` with the title, description, and duration of the video in the body.

```http
POST http://localhost:3333/videos
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "title": "My First Video",
    "description": "This is an awesome video about CRUD operations.",
    "duration": 60
}
```

### List All Videos 📚

To retrieve a list of all videos, send a `GET` request to `/videos`.

```http
GET http://localhost:3333/videos
```

### Update a Video ✏️

To update an existing video, send a `PUT` request to `/videos/{id}` with the new title, description, and duration in the body. Replace `{id}` with the actual ID of the video you want to update.

```http
PUT http://localhost:3333/videos/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "title": "My Updated Video",
    "description": "This is an updated description.",
    "duration": 120
}
```

### Delete a Video 🗑️

To delete a video, send a `DELETE` request to `/videos/{id}`. Replace `{id}` with the actual ID of the video you want to delete.

```http
DELETE http://localhost:3333/videos/{id}
```

## Development 🛠️

This API uses the Fastify framework for its simplicity and high performance. The data is stored in a local Map, making CRUDOps ideal for educational purposes or small projects. If you're looking to expand this project, consider implementing persistence with a database or adding more features to the video management capabilities.

Enjoy building and managing your video collection with CRUDOps! 🚀
